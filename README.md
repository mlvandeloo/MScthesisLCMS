# LC/MS for Humanized Sterol Biosynthesis (HsS) Strains

This document describes the data wrangling and analysis steps used for LC/MS analysis for my thesis (TBD). Two raw data files are included - raw and data paths must be specified, but this code can be repeated for educational applications, i.e. other lab members wishing to repeat these analysis methods for additional experiments. Packages used are cited in the document. To view the entire file as an html site, navigate to https://mlvandeloo.github.io/MScthesisLCMS/.
